<p>
The "<b>snes_faust</b>" emulation module is experimental, and not used automatically by default except for SPC playback.  To use this module rather than the "<b><a href="snes.html">snes</a></b>" module, you must either set the "snes.enable" setting to "0", or pass "-force_module snes_faust" to Mednafen each time it is invoked. 
</p>
<p>
PAL games and special cart chips are not supported, and the only
input device currently emulated is the standard SNES gamepad.  Timing is approximate, so some games may exhibit timing-related issues.
</p>
<p>
A unique feature to this module(at the current time) is optional 1-frame speculative execution, disabled by default, controlled by the <a href="#snes_faust.spex">snes_faust.spex</a>
setting.  Enabling it will reduce input(controller)->output(video) latency by 1 video frame(~16.7ms), with no deleterious effects on most games tested(though it will increase CPU usage a bit).  Combine it
with the setting changes <a href="mednafen.html#Section_minimize_video_lag">recommended here</a> for a better netplay experience.
