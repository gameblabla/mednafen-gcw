Mednafen GCW0
===========================
Version 1.2
Port by gameblabla

Here is a port of Mednafen for GCW0.
Only cores for PC Engine (CD), NEC PC-FX, and GB/GBA/NES/LYNX are included as separates OPKs.
For other cores, you should use the other emulators available on the platform instead. 
(Mednafen's cores are accurate and way too slow)

CONTROLS
================

Exit 				: Select + X
Configure Controls 	: Start  + X

================
INSTALLATION
================
First of all,
put the file mednafen-09x.cfg in /media/home/.mednafen.
If the folder ".mednafen" does not exist, create it and place the file there.

Then, put all opk files in /media/data/apps.
You should then find them in the "Emulators" section.

PCFX requires a BIOS called pcfx.rom to be placed in /media/home/.mednafen
PC Engine CD games requires a syscard called syscard3.pce. (same directory)
