Mednafen GCW0
===========================
Version 1.1
Port by gameblabla

Here is a port of Mednafen for GCW0.
It has most of the cores Mednafen has available.

With Mednafen, you can play games on the following platforms :

- Neo Pocket Color/Mono,
- NES/Famicom Disk,
- PSX (slow)
- Megadrive
- Snes (based on bsnes so it's slow)
- PC-FX (slow)
- Master System/Game Gear
- Game Boy
- Game Boy Advance
- PC-Engine, Supergrafx (Pretty fast)
- Wonderswan (Accurate but slower than Gameblabla's Oswan)

The PSX core is released as a separate OPK due to technical reasons.
In Gmenu, it is shown as Mednafen PSX.

INSTALLATION
================
First of all,
put the file mednafen-09x.cfg in /usr/local/home/.mednafen.
If the folder ".mednafen" does not exist, create it and place the file there.

Then, put both opk files in /media/data/apps.

You should then find them in the "Emulators" section.
For your PSX isos, use Mednafen PSX and for the other cores, use Mednafen.
